## Getting Started on Your Journey

Ready to embark? Here's how to set up your personal Adventurer's Guild Hall:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually bundled with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (version 10.4.1 as per your `package.json`)

### Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd [YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY]
    ```
3.  Install the necessary dependencies using pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
4.  Build the TypeScript code:
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
5.  Start the application:
    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

   This will typically launch the Fastify server, and you can access the application in your web browser (likely at `http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]`, depending on your Fastify setup).

### Development Mode

For a smoother development experience, you can use the `dev` script:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Once the application is running, you'll find a user-friendly interface where you can:

* **Add a Quest:** Look for the "New Quest" button or similar to input the details of your next adventure.
* **View Quests:** Your active quests will be displayed in a clear and organized list.
* **Favorite a Quest:** Click the star icon or a similar indicator next to a quest to mark it as a favorite.
